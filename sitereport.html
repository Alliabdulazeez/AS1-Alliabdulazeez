        <h2>Report on learning experience of web development.</h2>
        <p>
            My initial stage of learning HTML and CSS was particularly rewarding as an individual who began to see my creations come to life on the web.  Web development gives opportunity for high degree of creativity, designing of layouts, choosing color schemes, and implementing interactive features for total expression. The journey has been filled with lots of ups and downs, challenges and mentioning few of them starting with the ups which includes the likes of channeling out my creativity level, problem-solving skills in finding elegant solutions to complex problems can boost confidence and motivation. 
The downs include the likes of debugging codes and troubleshooting errors, an integral part that can be frustrating. Time consumption plays a big role as well in terms of balancing time with other responsibilities and avoiding burnouts can be highly challenging. 
Challenges were faced while on this journey and ways of overcoming then includes seeking help, taking breaks and being able to embrace failure and using it as a steppingstone towards success. By staying persistent and seeking support I was able to overcome obstacles and achieve tangible goals in web development.
